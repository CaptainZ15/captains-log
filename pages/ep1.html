                    <h3>Captains Log End; Epilogue: This final message went to Corey: 
                        Don’t worry about it. Noah just told me what you messaged him. 
                        Im done with the server. None of you ever message me to talk or 
                        play anything (mainly cause all you guys play is league), so there’s 
                        really no point in me still being in the server. Not to mention, what 
                        you told noah is fucking terrible. But, that’s okay. You’ll soon have 
                        three less people taking up your precious server space (which, btw, is 
                        basically infinite). If we are all taking up spaces you can use for other 
                        people, why not kick all the people that never get on and never post, and 
                        haven’t done anything on the server in months? But whatever. You do what you 
                        want with the server. The. Not your server, THE server, cause I helped you 
                        make it. I told you about discord to begin with. I hand-drew the fucking server 
                        picture, and came up with the name, you were just the one to click the  “create server” 
                        button, but I don’t give a fuck anymore. I have all the people that give a fuck 
                        about me in the other server. Have fun with Morgan, the compulsive liar, Jared, 
                        the complete and total asshole, and… oh wait, that’s it besides Rachel and that 
                        Kathulu kid (that doesn’t know how to spell Cthulhu) because nobody beside them 
                        ever connects to the server. Guess you have a lot of slots to fill.
