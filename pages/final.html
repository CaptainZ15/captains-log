                    <h3>Captains Log; Final Entry: It's been over two years since our departure, 
                        and it has been a wonderful existence upon the Sanctuary. Conflicts have 
                        been only minor in nature, and brief in duration. As of today, 02/22/2019, 
                        I have learned that the main server has been destroyed by it's creator. 
                        This was due to the core reason we initially fled, Jared and Morgan. It 
                        appears that Corey has come to realize what we had realized two years ago. 
                        What was destroyed by him today, is in the process of re-building, and 
                        hopefully the horrors that plagued that server never repeat themselves. With 
                        Cullen exiled to the far reaches of a distant place unknown, and the passage 
                        of time leading to busier lives, I feel that co-existence with Moonlight's 
                        Requiem may be possible. Right now, everything is well, the Sanctuary is safe, 
                        and I look forward towards the future. Whatever comes our way, I am confident 
                        that we can face it. Only time will tell what our future holds. On this day, 
                        02/22/2019, I leave this record of our travels, and hope that future generations 
                        learn from our mistakes. Good luck, and Goodbye.
