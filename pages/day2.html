                    <h3>Captains Log Day 2: As we were monitoring the main server, there 
                        have been troubling discoveries. A massive influx of strange people 
                        has befallen the server. Upon further investigation, we have found 
                        out that Pig is responsible. Some of the new people seem decent, while 
                        others are very strange. I do not yet know what this means for the future 
                        of our crew. It seems that most, if not all, play League of Legends, and 
                        as I know from experience, that could very well send the main server into 
                        discord (pun intended). Troubling times may be ahead, but for now our 
                        spirits are still relatively high.</h3>
