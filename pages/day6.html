                    <h3>Captains Log Day 6: Today can only be described as a 
                        catastrophe so large that nobody was left untriggered 
                        by what occurred on this horrible Thursday night. What 
                        began as a relatively peaceful afternoon soon spiraled 
                        into unparalleled lunacy and I am sure that things will 
                        never be the same after today. My recount of the events 
                        that transpired on this dreary night in January are gruesome, 
                        but it is necessary that what happened on this day is never to 
                        be repeated.

                        we received an alert from our automated threat assessment 
                        center about Cullen the Womanizer. As we read through the 
                        chat log to assess the threat, we came across disturbing 
                        flirtatious messages towards BonBon, who was rather new to 
                        the server. Joanna, in attempt to stop yet another victim of 
                        his fake friendship and womanizing ways, teleported to the main 
                        server’s chat communications and began to nullify his plan to 
                        seduce BonBon.

                        very confused by the situation, and Joanna messaged 
                        him about Cullen’s lecherous ways. He sided with Joanna 
                        immediately. BonBon was somewhat oblivious as to what was 
                        happening in the chat at the moment, but realized that 
                        Joanna was typing in the chat. She pined for Joanna’s friendship 
                        in that moment, and it seemed that they would be good friends, 
                        but that was not to be.

                        irritation and his desire to harm himself by drinking poisonous liquids. 
                        Noticing his melodrama, Joanna swiftly calls him out on his self-destructive 
                        behavior. This only serves to activate his defense mechanisms of being even 
                        more melodramatic and emo. Some time passes and as other members of the main 
                        server are chatting, Cullen chimes in with an insult about women. Joanna 
                        notices the remarkable amount of hypocrisy in his statement due to Cullen’s 
                        previous interactions with women, and tells him that if he would stop his 
                        womanizing ways, he would be able to find true love.

                        path of total meltdown. As they insult each other back and forth, 
                        Cullen slowly gets more and more roasted by Joanna’s logical comebacks 
                        and arguments. Cullen, unable to see the logic, had shut his brain off 
                        to avoid realizing he was wrong. BonBon was too influenced by Cullen 
                        at this point to be able to see reason, and tells Joanna that she is 
                        an asshole and should stop insulting Cullen. Refusing all logic and 
                        rationality, BonBon also fails to accept the reality of Cullen’s womanizing 
                        ways and posts private conversations between her and Joanna in an attempt 
                        to invalidate Joanna’s argument. This did not work, however, as most people, 
                        myself included, saw that Joanna’s messages to BonBon only further supported 
                        her argument.
